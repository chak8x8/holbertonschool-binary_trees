/**
 * binary_tree_preorder - Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse.
 * @func: A pointer to a function to call for each node.
 *
 * Description: This function visits the current node first, then traverses
 * the left subtree, followed by the right subtree. The value of each visited
 * node is passed as an argument to the function pointed to by `func`.
 *
 * Return: Nothing. If `tree` or `func` is NULL, the function does nothing.
